# Flappy Bird

![welcome](assets/flappy_welcome.png)

This Flappy Bird game, built with Python and Pygame, is a 2D side-scroller where players navigate a bird through randomly generated pipes by flapping its wings with the spacebar. Featuring smooth physics, collision detection, and a scoring system, it showcases my skills in game development and Pygameâ€™s sprite and event-handling capabilities. The simple yet addictive design is presented in a 400x600 window with a scrolling background.
